# Studybot

This chatbot is an example for _Chatbots: Development and Applications_.

It is not intended to be run directly.
Instead, this project should be used as a reference for developing other chatbots in the future.


## Development

1. Make sure [Go](https://golang.org/) is installed.
2. Run `go run main.go -help` to see how to operate the service and which arguments are required.
3. Use `dep ensure -update` to update the dependencies (requires [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep)).
